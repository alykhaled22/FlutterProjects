A new Flutter project.

## What I've learned 

-I used {debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false} to hide the debug banner
-CircleAvatar Widget
-Divider Widget to divide two Widgets with horizontal line
-ListTile Widget is a fixed-height row that contains some text as well as a leading or trailing icon
-Card Widget: We usually use it with ListTile Widget to use shape or put a background
