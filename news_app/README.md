# news_app

A new Flutter News app.

## What I've learned

-RichText widget to style different parts of my text.
-ClipRRect widget to make borders of my images.
-CustomScrollView to scroll two lists with different directions and SliverList that has better performance than ListView.Builder in this case.
    -because with ListView.Builder I had to use {shrinkWrap: true} that build all widget at the same time.
-How to use Api
-Dio package
-Trigger endpoints
-async programming
-CircularProgressIndicator for a looding screen
-FutureBuilder "No need for stateful widget because it rebuilds the UI when data triggered "
-CachedNetworkImage package to deal with network images
-Factory constructor
